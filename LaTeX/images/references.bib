abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd. A double loop electrochemical potentiokinetic reactivation (DL-EPR) test was conducted to investigate the relationship between the evolution of delta-ferrite and the intergranular corrosion (IGC) of Ti-modified Super304H, which was aged at 650. °C for 4-500. h. Scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy were adopted to analyze the evolution of delta-ferrite. The results indicated that a higher fraction of delta-ferrite with poor stability increased the IGC sensitisation of Ti-modified Super304H. Moreover, the self-healing of the sensitisation of Ti-modified Super304H occurred after 48. h due to the diffusion of chromium atoms mainly from the adjacent primary austenite rather than the delta-ferrite.},

abstract = {The influence of ferrite morphology and carbon content on the intergranular corrosion behavior of 308 stainless steel was investigated using four wrought alloys and six weld deposited alloys. The four wrought alloys were heat treated at four different annealing temperatures to introduce four different amounts of ferrite. The annealed samples along with the weld deposited alloys were aged at temperatures ranging from 480 to 700°C for times varying between 15 min and 1000 h and then tested for intergranular corrosion susceptibility in acidified copper-copper sulfate solution. For a given carbon content there exists a critical amount and distribution of $\alpha$-$\gamma$ boundary area above which the alloy is immune and below which it is susceptible to intergranular corrosion. For amounts and distributions of $\alpha$-$\gamma$ boundary area less than the critical value two types of sensitization behavior are possible. First, there may be a sufficient amount and distribution of $\alpha$-$\gamma$ boundary area to insure rapid healing of the sensitized microstructure. Second, there may be an inadequate amount or distribution of $\alpha$-$\gamma$ boundary area to produce either immunity or rapid healing and the alloy behaves as a fully austenitic alloy regardless of the amount of ferrite present. A model is presented which describes as a function of carbon content the critical amounts and distributions of $\alpha$-$\gamma$ boundary area required for rapid healing and immunity to sensitization. {\textcopyright} 1980 American Society for Metals and the Metallurgical Society of AIME.},

abstract = {This paper investigates the microstructure and secondary phase precipitations obtained in UNS S32760 super duplex stainless steel and their effect on impact toughness and corrosion resistance. The heat treatment included first solution annealing at 1150 °C followed by water quenching, then isothermal heating at different temperatures from 350 to 950 °C for different times, ranging from less than 1 min to 600 min, followed by water quenching again. Microscopic investigation, microhardness tests, and x-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis were used to identify the microstructure and secondary phase precipitations formed by heat treatment. The study indicates a fair correlation between the microscopic observations and microhardness results, while XRD analysis defined the phase's chemistry and confirmed the microscopic and hardness results. In addition to the austenite ($\gamma$) and ferrite ($\alpha$) phases of the duplex structure, secondary phases of ($\sigma$, x, and chromium nitrides) are observed at a high temperature range, while (ά) and (aged ά) are observed at a lower temperature range. It is concluded that the microhardness test can be used to identify the phases appearing in the microstructure, which results in fair prediction for the TTT diagram and $\sigma$-phase range. The variation of toughness and corrosion resistance by heat treatment differs depending on the secondary phase formation. {\textcopyright} ASM International.},

abstract = {Losses from corrosion are a damage which is difficult to quantify at world level, and a large variety of service failure problems of materials is due mainly to corrosion-related problems. One of the localized types of corrosion is originated by exposure to stainless steel at work temperatures where the sensitization phenomenon occurs. This phenomenon occurs due to second stage precipitation at grain boundaries, whether by thermal treatment or by welding. In this study, a thermally treated steel AISI 304 was used, and it shows the results of various chemical and electrochemical attacks to reveal the presence of carbides at grain boundaries, chromium carbides are precursors of localized corrosion. Linear polarization was performed in the sensitized samples to estimate the repercussion of this phenomenon on the overall corrosion resistance of the stainless steel. Surface evaluation was carried out using a Scanning Electron Microscope and an EDS X-ray detector, through which it was possible to do an in situ chemical analysis of the particles and the extracted carbides, after having dissolved the steel matrix electrochemically. {\textcopyright} The Electrochemical Society.},

abstract = {In this work, the corrosion behavior of three differently treated AISI 316 stainless steel plates is investigated, viz. (1) pristine, (2) coated with a carbon nanotube (CNT) layer and (3) coated with a carbon nanofiber (CNF) layer. CNTs and CNFs were directly grown on stainless steel via a CVD method, using ethylene as the carbon source and without the addition of an external catalyst. The corrosion behavior of these materials was investigated by a combination of microstructural and electrochemical methods. Electrochemical tests included potentiodynamic and potentiostatic techniques in hot sulfuric acid solutions. A strong deterioration in corrosion resistance was revealed by the electrochemical tests and confirmed by microstructural examination of the samples. It was found that carbon diffusion into the substrate material during the CNT/CNF growth process results in chromium depletion of the near-surface region of 316 SS and chromium carbide precipitation at grain boundaries causing accelerated intergranular corrosion. Accordingly, notwithstanding the obvious inability of CNT/CNF layers to provide protection to the substrate due to their porous nature, a real corrosion damage arises from the high temperature exposure of stainless steel to the CVD atmosphere, suggesting that a similar risk may be present even for compact carbon coating deposited by CVD process, in the event of local damage of the coating. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Low temperature sensitization of 304LN stainless steel from the two pipes, differing slightly in chemical composition, has been investigated; specimens were aged at 623 K (350 C) for 20,000 hours and evaluated for intergranular corrosion and degree of sensitization. The base and heat-affected zone (HAZ) of the 304LN-1 appear resistant to sensitization, while 304LN-2 revealed a "dual" type microstructure at the transverse section and HAZ. The microstructure at 5.0-mm distance from the fusion line indicates qualitatively less sensitization as compared to that at 2.0 mm. The 304LN-2 base alloy shows overall lower degree of sensitization values as compared to the 304LN-1. A similar trend of degree of sensitization was observed in the HAZ where it was higher in the 304LN-1 as compared to the 304LN-2. The weld zone of both the stainless steels suffered from cracking during ASTM A262 practice E, while the parent metals and HAZs did not show such fissures. A mottled image within the ferrite lamella showed spinodal decomposition. The practice E test and transmission electron microscopy results indicate that the interdendritic regions may suffer from failure due to carbide precipitation and due to the evolution of brittle phase from spinodal decomposition. {\textcopyright} 2012 The Minerals, Metals  {\&}  Materials Society and ASM International.},

Cast duplex stainless steel, alloy 2205, a mix of ferrite and austenite, was heat-treated at 845°C which produced additional phases, e.g., sigma and chi. The new phases depleted the surrounding grains of passivity-promoting elements such as Cr, causing alloy sensitization and a corresponding decrease in pitting resistance. A low temperature gas-phase interstitial hardening (IH) surface modification process was used to surface alloy sensitized samples. Anodic polarization curves showed that after IH treatment, the pitting resistance, determined by the pitting potential, of sensitized samples was restored to values of the as-cast material.},
