    "This page is dedicated to describe how to search for dissertations in the ProQuest Dissertations and Theses (Dissertation Abstracts) database. Due to constraints of Proquest and a lack of digitized dissertations, it is not possible to precisely bring up a list of all the dissertations for any department. The goal of this guide is to provide the reader information on how to get the highest search return of a department's dissertations. While these searches are geared toward specific departments at UC Berkeley, you can adapt these searches to find dissertations from other departments and universities/colleges."
