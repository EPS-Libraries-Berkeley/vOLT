1. Why was the data collected? <br>   
    The data was collected by the National Home Owner’s Loan Corporation (HOLC) in 1933 as part of the New Deal. HOLC worked with banks to assess real estate to determine the “credit-worthiness” of potential homeowners based on zipcode. HOLC filled in information about sections that included: 
    - Inhabitants (undesirables)
    - Foreign born
    - “Negro”
    - Type (e.g. business man, retired capitalist, etc.)
    - Favorable influences
    - Detrimental influences <br>
    
    Based on each assessment, a neighborhood was assigned a grade. An “A” grade neighborhood, represented by the color green and inhabited by white people, signified a minimal risk for banks and mortgage lenders. Neighborhoods that received a “D” grade, represented by the color red and inhabited by BIPOC Americans, signified a high risk, enabling lenders to refuse loans for homes in redlined neighborhoods. The inhabitants of redlined neighborhoods, Black Americans, Asian Americans, and other people of color, were intentionally denied mortgages, which prevented them from acquiring and building wealth through property - a denial that had deleterious effects on many BIPOC Americans for generations to come. 
    
2. What are the limitations of the data? <br>       
    The data describes neighborhoods and zipcodes based on a predetermined set of characteristics to determine funding. These characteristics (except for the description of terrain) are racist and discriminatory. 
    - Description of terrain
    - Inhabitants (which inludes type, estimated annual family income, foreign-born; and Negro)
    - Buildings
    - History of sale values and rental values
    - Trend of desirability next 10-15 years
    - Clarifying remarks
