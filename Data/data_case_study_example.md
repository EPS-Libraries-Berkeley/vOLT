1. Why was the data collected? <br>   
    The data was collected by the National Home Owner’s Loan Corporation (HOLC) in 1933 as part of the New Deal. HOLC worked with banks to assess real estate to determine the “credit-worthiness” of potential homeowners based on zipcode. HOLC filled in information about sections that included: 
    - Inhabitants (undesirables)
    - Foreign born
    - “Negro”
    - Type (e.g. business man, retired capitalist, etc.)
    - Favorable influences
    - Detrimental influences <br>
    
2. What are the limitations of the data? <br>       
The data describes neighborhoods and zipcodes based on a predetermined set of characteristics to determine funding. These characteristics (except for the category of terrain) are racist and discriminatory.
